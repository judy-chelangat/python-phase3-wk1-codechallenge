# Coding Challenges

Welcome to the Coding Challenges repository! Here you will find three intriguing coding challenges designed to enhance problem-solving skills and coding abilities. Each challenge is described below along with specific instructions on how to tackle it.

## Challenge 1: Converting 12-hour time to 24-hour time

### Description

In this challenge, you will implement a function to convert a given 12-hour time to its corresponding 24-hour time representation.

### Task

Create a function `convert_to_24_hour(hour: int, minute: int, period: str) -> str`. The function should take an hour (ranging from 1 to 12), a minute (ranging from 0 to 59), and a period ("am" or "pm") as inputs. It should then return a four-digit string representing the time in the 24-hour format.

## Challenge 2: Two numbers are positive

### Description

Your objective is to write a function that determines whether exactly two out of three given integers are positive numbers.

### Task

Implement a function `two_positive(a: int, b: int, c: int) -> bool`. This function should take three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` as arguments and return `True` if exactly two out of the three integers are positive numbers (greater than zero), and `False` otherwise.

## Challenge 3: Consonant value

### Description

In this challenge, you will create a function to calculate the highest value of consonant substrings in a given lowercase string.

### Task

Write a function `consonant_value(s: str) -> int` that takes a lowercase string `s` containing only alphabetic characters and no spaces. The function should return the highest value of consonant substrings based on the provided value assignments: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, ..., z = 26.

## Running the Code

To test your solutions for these challenges, follow these steps:

1. Open your preferred code editor or development environment.

2. Create a new Python file for each challenge (e.g., `challenge1.py`, `challenge2.py`, `challenge3.py`).

3. Implement the corresponding functions according to the provided descriptions.

4. Save the files.

5. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where your Python files are located.

6. Run the Python interpreter by typing `python` followed by the name of the file you want to test (e.g., `python challenge1.py`).

7. In the Python interpreter, you can call the function with different inputs to verify its correctness.
